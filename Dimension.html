    <h2>For what a 3D Software?</h2>
        While 3D CAD programs are traditionally used
        <br>in the fields of engineering, architecture,
        <br>and making things in general, 
        3D modeling can
        <br> also be applied to the field of 
        cinematography. 
        <br>
        3D Artists create:
          <ul>
        <li>3D Objects / Creatures</li>
        <li>Animation</li>
        <li>digital Sculpting</li>
        <li>Environment Design</li>
        <li>Game Design</li>
          </ul>
        and whole worlds in programs like Autodesk Maya
        <br>or 3DS Max for animations and product visualizations.
            
</div>
  
  <div class="column">
    <h2>Why 3rd Dimension?</h2>
        Animations and technical visualizations put your product and your brand in a special light and make complex and difficult to explain processes
        and facts understandable and tangible for everyone.
        <br>
        <br>
        Animation is an important part of content Marketing in the B2B area and therefore a key factor in the dialogue between experts.
        Product models created with Computer Generated Imagery offer many advantages. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Some products are difficult to photograph due to their size or texture.
        With CGI you save yourself trips to exotic locations and benefit from the flexibility of a 3D model. 
        This can be used in many ways and changed quickly.

3D models are real creative boosters. Thanks to them, products can be changed relatively quickly or displayed with different surfaces.
    </div>
  
  <div class="column">
    <h2>Virtual Reality</h2>
        Link animations with a virtual reality Presentation or a 360 degree Video. This brings your communication to a new visual level
        and transfers information into a new world that can be perceived with all the senses.
        <br>
        <br>
        Virtual reality (VR) is a simulated experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world. 
        Applications of virtual reality include entertainment (e.g. video games) and business (e.g. virtual meetings). 
        <br>
        <br>
        Other distinct types of VR-style technology include augmented reality and mixed reality, sometimes referred to as extended reality or XR.
        Currently, standard virtual reality systems use either virtual reality headsets or multi-projected environments to generate realistic images, 
        sounds and other sensations that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual environment.

    <h2>The Software</h2>
    <p>Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline—modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, 
      compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation. Advanced users employ Blender’s API for Python scripting to customize the 
      application and write specialized tools; often these are included in Blender’s future releases. Blender is well suited to individuals and small 
      studios who benefit from its unified pipeline and responsive development process. Examples from many Blender-based projects are available in the showcase.
      Blender is cross-platform and runs equally well on Linux, Windows, and Macintosh computers. Its interface uses OpenGL to provide a consistent experience.</p>

    <p>As a community-driven project under the GNU General Public License (GPL), the public is empowered to make small and large changes to the code base, which leads to new features, 
      responsive bug fixes, and better usability. Blender has no price tag, but you can invest, participate, and help to advance a powerful collaborative tool: Blender is your own 3D software.
      More help is always welcome! From developing and improving Blender to writing documentation, etc, there are a number of different things you can do to get involved.</p>

    <h2>The Software</h2>
    <p>Unity is the world's leading real-time 3D development platform, everything you need to create, operate, 
      and monetize great games and experiences across the broadest range of platforms in the industry. 
      Develop once, deploy everywhere, inspire everyone.
      Game engines, also called game frameworks, are special software that game developers use to create both 2D and 3D video games. 
      As a game engine, Unity is a great platform for designing imaginary worlds, calculating physics for objects in these worlds to move, 
      jump or collide, play sounds, and more. Developers also love game engines like Unity due to the fact they provide reusable code that 
      every game would need. This means less time is spent rebuilding the wheel and more time creating exciting new content.</p>

      <p>Like most game engines, Unity has five components. The primary component is a program that contains the game logic, 
      a rendering engine that generates 3D animated graphics. An audio engine component provides algorithms to create and manipulate sounds. 
      For physical laws, a physics engine handles movement and collisions. For non-player actions and decisions, there is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) component.</p>

    <h2>The Software</h2>
    <p>Unreal Engine is a game development engine. It was developed by Epic Games in the year 1988. 
      Initially, it was developed as a first-person shooter game. Presently it is being used to create 
      fighting games, RPGs, Stealth, and other MMORPGs. The game used C++ language coding. This game is 
      popular among game developers and is used by them as a tool in game development. Although most of 
      the developers use Unity for game creation, It offers basic developing techniques that help beginners and freshers a lot.</p>
    
      <p>It is an amazing and unique game Engine that helps the user to create games. It comprises various mechanisms that provide
      a platform to the users and help them to run the game. It has a huge systematic set of tools and editors that help users manage
      their properties and modify them to create the artwork for their games. The engine comprises of parts that include a graphics engine, online module, physics engine, 
      sound engine, input, and Gameplay Framework. It has several editors that help in the development of the game. On startup, It has Unreal Editor by default. 
      This Editor is the main editor that helps the user view and works with other sub-platforms and editors.</p>
