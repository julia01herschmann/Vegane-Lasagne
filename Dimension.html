    <h2>For what a 3D Software?</h2>
            While 3D CAD programs are traditionally used
            <br>in the fields of engineering, architecture,
            <br>and making things in general, 
            3D modeling can
            <br> also be applied to the field of 
            cinematography. 
            <br>
            3D Artists create:
            <ul>
            <li>3D Objects / Creatures</li>
            <li>Animation</li>
            <li>digital Sculpting</li>
            <li>Environment Design</li>
            <li>Game Design</li>
            </ul>
            and whole worlds in programs like Autodesk Maya
            <br>or 3DS Max for animations and product visualizations.
            
</div>
  
  <div class="column">
    <h2>Why 3rd Dimension?</h2>
    <ul>
        Animations and technical visualizations put your product and your brand in a special light and make complex and difficult to explain processes
        and facts understandable and tangible for everyone.
        <br>
        Animation is an important part of content Marketing in the B2B area and therefore a key factor in the dialogue between experts.
    </ul>
    </div>
  
  <div class="column">
    <h2>Virtual Reality</h2>
    <ul>
        Link animations with a virtual reality Presentation or a 360 degree Video. This brings your communication to a new visual level
        and transfers information into a new world that can be perceived with all the senses.
        <br>
        Virtual reality applications offer the viewer a special experience and are absolute crowd pullers at trade fairs and events.

    <h2>The Software</h2>
    <p>Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline—modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even 
      video editing and game creation. Advanced users employ Blender’s API for Python scripting to customize the application and write specialized tools; often these are included in Blender’s future releases. 
      Blender is well suited to individuals and small studios who benefit from its unified pipeline and responsive development process. Examples from many Blender-based projects are available in the showcase.
      Blender is cross-platform and runs equally well on Linux, Windows, and Macintosh computers. Its interface uses OpenGL to provide a consistent experience. To confirm specific compatibility, 
      the list of supported platforms indicates those regularly tested by the development team.</p>
    <p>As a community-driven project under the GNU General Public License (GPL), the public is empowered to make small and large changes to the code base, which leads to new features, 
      responsive bug fixes, and better usability. Blender has no price tag, but you can invest, participate, and help to advance a powerful collaborative tool: Blender is your own 3D software.
      More help is always welcome! From developing and improving Blender to writing documentation, etc, there are a number of different things you can do to get involved.</p>
